# Methodology

This project has the intent of simulating a real work environment. For that, we decide to use some old techs, like JQuery which is a very used lib.
It's common to find sites that are still running with JQuery. Becomes important to understand and learn how these old libs work.

To drive development we use:

-   [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) - Is a framework that helps teams work together.
-   [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) - Is an alternative Git branching model that involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches.
